Description: MEIGOR provides a comprehensive environment for performing global 
    optimization tasks in bioinformatics and systems biology.
    It leverages advanced metaheuristic algorithms to efficiently
    search the solution space and is specifically tailored to handle
    the complexity and high-dimensionality of biological datasets.
    This package supports various optimization routines and is integrated
    with Bioconductor's infrastructure for a seamless analysis workflow.
